-- adding indices improved by 20 percent as seen from explain plan
-- this improved performance is for DMLs using where clauses where those columns are used
-- this will have a negative impact on insert or update statements since this means that
-- DB engine has to rescope the index each time when you insert a row
-- so same is not recommended if you do inserts more often
