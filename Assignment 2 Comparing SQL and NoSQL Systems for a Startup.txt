Scenario
A startup is deciding between SQL (PostgreSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) for their new e-commerce platform. They need a report comparing the two systems, focusing on structure, scalability, and use cases. You will analyze their product catalog requirements to recommend the best fit.

 
Research Differences: Investigate key differences between SQL (relational) and NoSQL (non-relational) systems. Focus on aspects like schema rigidity, scalability, transaction support, and query language.
SQL RDBMS works on rigid framework with predefined tables and columns within it where as NoSQL is flexible like Json files

Analyze Requirements: The startup’s catalog includes products with fixed attributes (ID, name, price) and variable attributes (color, size, reviews). Determine which system handles this better.
For fixed attributed RDBMS is better and so its query capacity. For variable attributes NoSQL performs better. 

Pros and Cons: List 3 advantages and disadvantages of each system for the startup’s needs. For example, SQL ensures ACID compliance, while NoSQL offers flexible schema.
Pros for RDBMS
1. Secured
2. ACID compliance
3. Ease in retrieving large amount of data
Cons for RDBMS
1. Hierarchical and non flexible in nature
2. Non distributed
3. Not good for dynamically evolving data models

Pros for NoSQL
1. Flexible in nature
2. distributed
3. good for dynamically evolving data models
Cons for noSQl
1. non Secured
2. ACID compliance is limited
3. Less query capability

Recommendation: Based on your analysis, recommend either SQL or NoSQL. Justify your choice with specific reasons (e.g., "SQL is better for transactional integrity").
Best fit would be to go with RDBMS since this is a start up ecommerce, gaining trust is important. RDBMS will ensure proper governance and role based accesses and control end user transactions in a better way
