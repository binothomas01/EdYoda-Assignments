Database Setup: Create an Employees table (employee_id, name, salary, department, hire_date) and a Departments table (department_id, name, location). Insert 10+ records with varied salaries and departments.

Basic Queries:

List employees earning more than $50,000, sorted by salary (DESC).
select * from employees emp, salaries sal
where emp.emp_id = sal.emp_id
and salary > 50000
order by salary desc ;

Count employees per department using GROUP BY.
select count(*) emp_cnt, dep.dept_name
from employees emp, departments dep
where emp.dept_id = dep.dept_id
group by dep.dept_name ;

Aggregate Functions:

Calculate the average salary by department.
select avg(sal.salary) avg_sal, dep.dept_name
from employees emp, departments dep, salaries sal
where emp.dept_id = dep.dept_id 
and emp.emp_id = sal.emp_id
group by dep.dept_name ;

Find the highest and lowest salaries company-wide.
select max(sal.salary) max_sal, Min(sal.salary) min_sal 
from employees emp,   salaries sal
where emp.emp_id = sal.emp_id ;

Date Filtering: List employees hired in the last 5 years (use WHERE with date functions).
select * from employees where hire_date <= current_date() - 5 ;
